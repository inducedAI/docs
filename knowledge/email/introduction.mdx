<Note>
  Workspace email addresses provide a unique way to manage authentication and automate tasks such as two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, verification, and magic links.

## Overview

Workspace email addresses (`workspace@induced.email`) are directly associated with your Induced workspace. They enable you to configure authentication and other capabilities, streamlining your workflow and enhancing security.

## Use Cases

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Automatically forward 2FA emails to your workspace email address, where the Induced agent can read and act upon them.
- **One-time verification Links:** Foward one-time links to the workspace email address for secure, one-click authentication.
