<Note>
  This guide delves into the advanced capabilities of variables in Induced, focusing on interacting with more than just text data and capturing screenshots for deeper analysis.

## Capturing Full Page Screenshots

1. **Access the Expandable Menu**: Next to the Save button, find the expandable menu and select "Capture Screenshot."

2. **Capture Entire Page**: Choose the "Entire Page" option to take a screenshot of the entire webpage. This action will create a new variable, such as "Screenshot 1," containing the screenshot image.

## Capturing Focused Screenshots

1. **Select Specific Areas**: Instead of capturing the entire page, you can select a specific area of the page by choosing the "Select" option. This adds an overlay to the page, allowing you to drag and create a selection around the desired area.

2. **Confirm Selection**: After making your selection, click on "Confirm Selection." A new log will be added, and a variable will be created for the focused screenshot, capturing only the selected area.

## Exporting and Using Screenshots

1. **Export Variables**: Any variable created in the studio, whether it's a data point or a screenshot, can be independently exported and viewed at the end of a workflow run.

2. **Utilize Screenshots in Prompts**: Screenshots can be used as part of prompts in the Agent section to extract specific information or context. For example, you can ask the agent to describe what is seen in a screenshot or to extract a list of article titles from an image.

<Tip>
  Screenshots offer a powerful way to capture visual data and use it for reasoning in your workflows. They can be used to provide context, extract information, or even format data in different ways (e.g., YAML, JSON, bullet points) using the agent.

## Conclusion

The ability to capture screenshots and use them alongside variables opens up new possibilities for automation in Induced. By combining visual and textual data, you can create workflows that are more intelligent and adaptable to a variety of use cases.
