## Getting Started with Induced Training Studio

Induced Training Studio is where you'll create and manage your workflows. It features a remote interactable browser on the left side, resembling a real browser with a search bar, buttons, and a display area.

## Creating Your First Workflow

1. **Navigate to a URL**: To start training a workflow, go to a specific URL. For example, to create a Google search workflow, type `google.com` in the search bar and click on the search icon. The browser will navigate to Google, and the step will be recorded as "navigated to google.com."

2. **Interact with Elements**: Continue by interacting with elements on the page, such as clicking on the search bar or typing a query. The system will detect and record your actions, such as "clicked on search" or "typed 'ai news today'."

3. **Edit and Delete Steps**: Each recorded step comes with options to edit or delete. If a step is incorrect, you can modify it by clicking the edit option or remove it entirely by clicking the delete option.

4. **Use Additional Controls**: Utilize the scroll buttons to record scrolling actions. The "scroll down" and "scroll up" buttons allow you to capture vertical navigation within the page.

5. **Manage Workflow Steps**: If you need to restart or remove all recorded steps, use the "clear all" button. You can also use the refresh and back buttons to control the browser, similar to a regular web browser.

<Tip>
  The Induced Training Studio is designed to be intuitive, allowing you to train workflows by performing actions as you would in your own browser. Pay attention to the logs on the right side to ensure your steps are accurately captured.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily create a basic workflow for navigating the web using Induced Training Studio. As you become more familiar with the platform, you can explore more complex workflows and automation tasks.

<Info>
  Remember to save your workflow once you've completed the training process. You can then run it through the API or the Induced front end to automate your web navigation tasks.
