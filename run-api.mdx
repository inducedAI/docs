<Note>
  This guide explains how to run your workflows in Induced using the API, enabling automation and integration with other systems.
</Note>

## Accessing the API

1. **Navigate to the Run Section**: From the homepage, go to the "Run" section and select a workflow you've created.

2. **Open the API Modal**: Click on the "API" button located at the top right, next to the "Run" button. This opens a pop-up with code snippets for running your workflow via API using curl, Python, or JavaScript.

## Running the Workflow via API

1. **Copy the Code Snippet**: Select and copy the code snippet that suits your needs. For example, you can copy the curl request provided in the modal.

2. **Execute the Request**: Open your terminal or command line interface and paste the copied curl command. The command includes your API key, the learning ID for the workflow, and any necessary variables.

3. **Modify Variables**: If your workflow requires input variables, replace the placeholders in the command with the appropriate values. For example, if the workflow was trained on "Tesla," you can replace the search term with "BlackRock" to analyze a different stock.

4. **Send the Request**: Execute the curl command in your terminal. Upon success, it will return a browser ID and initiate the workflow run.

## Monitoring the Workflow Run

1. **Check the Status**: Use the API to retrieve the status of your workflow run. You can send a request to the endpoint provided in the developer docs, including the run ID and your API key.

2. **View the Output**: Once the workflow has completed, you can view the output variables, such as screenshots and summaries, in the response from the API.

<Tip>
  Running workflows via API allows you to automate tasks and integrate Induced workflows into your existing systems or applications. Make sure to monitor the status of your workflow runs to ensure successful completion.
