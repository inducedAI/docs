## Understanding Variables

Variables in Induced allow you to store and manipulate data captured during your workflow. They are essential for creating dynamic and adaptable automation processes.

## Capturing Specific Data

1. **Access the Drop-Down Menu**: Next to the save button, there's a drop-down menu with various options, including "Capture Data."

2. **Extract Data**: Use the "Capture Data" option to extract specific information from a webpage. For example, you can give a command like "extract the title of the first news article" and click send. The system will identify and highlight the relevant data on the page.

3. **Accept the Captured Data**: If the captured data is correct, click "accept" to add it as a step in your workflow. This will also create a variable containing the extracted data.

## Using Variables

1. **Insert Variables**: Go to the "Insert Variables" section from the drop-down menu to see the created variables, such as "first news title."

2. **Inject Variable Values**: You can use the "inject" button to insert the value of a captured variable into an input field, like a search bar. This allows for dynamic automation based on captured data.

## Advanced Usage with the Agent

1. **Model Calls with the Agent**: The agent section allows you to make model calls to GPT-4 or other models. For example, you can prompt the agent to come up with a greeting or summarize information.

2. **Create Variables from Agent Outputs**: Outputs generated by the agent can also be turned into variables, which can then be used in further automation steps.

3. **Combine Variables and Agent Prompts**: You can use captured variables as part of the prompts for the agent to generate more context-specific outputs. For example, asking the agent to summarize a news article based on its title.

<Tip>
  The combination of data capture, variables, and the agent opens up a wide range of possibilities for automation in Induced. Experiment with these features to create more intelligent and adaptable workflows.

## Conclusion

By mastering the use of variables, data capture, and the agent in Induced, you can create powerful automation workflows that are both dynamic and context-aware. Whether you're summarizing content, analyzing profiles, or automating searches, these tools provide the flexibility and intelligence needed for advanced automation tasks.
