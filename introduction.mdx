description: 'Essential documentation for utilizing the Induced API to manage browser sessions and automate tasks with natural language'
---

<Note>
  The Induced Dev Environment API is designed to enable developers to create browser sessions and execute automated steps through natural language commands. This document outlines the use of the API and provides guidance on getting started.
</Note>

## Base URL

This API empowers developers to create, manage, and interact with browser sessions programmatically. Utilizing natural language processing, the Induced Development Environment provides a robust interface for automation tasks in a browser context.

```
https://api.induced.ai/v1/develop
```

## Authentication

To maintain security and integrity, all API requests require authentication. Include your `x-api-key` in the headers of each request.

```json
x-api-key: [API_KEY_HERE]
```

## Response Codes

Understanding the significance of each HTTP response code will guide you in handling API requests effectively. Here's what each one indicates:

- `200` - **Success**: Your request was executed successfully.
- `400` - **Bad Request**: The request was malformed or contains an error preventing it from being fulfilled.
- `401` - **Unauthorized**: Authentication credentials are missing or incorrect.
- `403` - **Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
- `404` - **Not Found**: The requested resource is not available at this time.
- `500` - **Internal Server Error**: An unexpected condition was encountered on the server.

<Tip>
Each code is part of a broader categorization where `2xx` codes represent successful operations, `4xx` codes indicate client errors, and `5xx` codes point to server errors. Pay close attention to these in your integration to ensure smooth functionality.

## Caveats
As the Induced API is in beta, we are continually refining our features. While changes are anticipated, we strive to limit any that are breaking:
- 1. The API and its schema may change at any time without prior notice. Please keep this in mind when integrating with your applications.
- 2. Some of the features described in this documentation may not be available in the beta release. We are working hard to implement them as soon as possible.
- 3. There could be scenarios where the step is not correctly executed but has been marked as completed. We're working on improving the accuracy of our step execution and verification as well.

<Info>
  We value your input on our beta release. Your feedback is instrumental in shaping the future of the Induced Dev Environment API.
