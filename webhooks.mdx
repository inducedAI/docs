## Webhooks Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events that occur within your browser sessions or during the execution of steps. They are HTTP callbacks that receive a POST request with a payload containing information about the event.

## Common Payload Structure

When an event occurs, you'll receive a payload with a common structure, though the contents may differ based on the event type. Below are the typical structures:

```json
{
    "sessionId" : "browser_iwnx132n1",
    "type" : "browser",
    "data": {
        "eventType":"browser_ready",
        "status" : "READY",
        "streamingUrl" : "https://chromebrowser.stream/streams?id=XXX"
    }
}
```

For events related to steps:

```json
{
    "sessionId" : "browser_iwnx132n1",
    "type" : "step",
    "data": {
        "eventType" : "step_completed",
        "stepId" : "step_1md2ndakk",
        "status" : "COMPLETED",
        "result" : [], // only if there is data extraction in that step
        "url" : "https://example.com",
        "screenshot" : "https://induced.delivery/XXX"
    }
}
```

## Events

Your application can subscribe to two main types of events:

- **Browser Events**: Notifications related to the browser instance state.
- **Step Events**: Notifications concerning individual steps within a browser session.

### Browser Events

| Event Type     | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `browser_ready`| Fired when the browser instance is ready for interaction. |

### Step Events

| Event Type     | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `step_completed` | Triggered after a step has been successfully completed. |

## Receiving Webhooks

To receive webhooks, you need to configure a URL endpoint that is accessible over the internet. The configured endpoint will receive a `POST` request with the payload for each subscribed event.

<Box>
Please ensure that your endpoint is capable of handling HTTPS POST requests and is configured to accept JSON payloads.
</Box>

## Security

We strongly recommend validating the payloads you receive to ensure they are from our service. This can be done by verifying signatures, if provided, or through other mutually agreed security measures.

## Handling Failures

If your endpoint fails to receive a webhook, our system may attempt to resend it. Ensure that your endpoint is idempotent to avoid duplicated event handling.
