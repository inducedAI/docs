### Polling with the Run ID

To track the progress of your extraction task, send a GET request to `/extract/{id}`, where `{id}` is replaced with the run ID you received. This ID is the key for obtaining the status of your extraction task.

#### Path Parameter

- `id`: The unique identifier for your extraction task.

The API will continue to provide updates on the status of your extraction with each poll. The field of interest in the response is `data.run.status`. When this field's value changes to `COMPLETED`, it indicates that the extraction has finished successfully. At this point, you can proceed to use the contents of `data.run.output` for your desired operations.

Here's what you should monitor after each poll:

- `data.run.status`: The status of the extraction task, which you're hoping to reach a value of `COMPLETED`.
- `data.run.output`: The output or result of your extraction task, available once the status is `COMPLETED`.

<Note>
Store the run ID securely after receiving it from the POST response. You'll use this ID to poll the GET endpoint for the status of the extraction task.
Once the extraction status is `COMPLETED`, the run output will be ready for retrieval.
